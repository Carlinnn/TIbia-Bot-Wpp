## About The Project

If you want an easy start on getting commands on your [WhatsApp](https://web.whatsapp.com) Bot. This project comes in with many in-built useful and flexible features, this is the only template project you will need

Here's why:

- **Dynamic Command Handler**:

  - The command handler, you don't need to indulge in main bot files to create your very own command!
  - You can simply make command groups (categorized as folders) in the [commands](https://github.com/Nata4n/whatsapp-bot/tree/main/src/commands) folder.

- **Dynamic Event Handler**:
  - All events goes inside the [controllers](https://github.com/Nata4n/whatsapp-bot/tree/main/src/controllers) folder. You don't need to use `socks.ev.on()` in the main file to handle events.
  - Using simple skeleton code for events, you can make any amount of events in the events folder using the event handler.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
